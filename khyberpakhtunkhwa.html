   <p class="kpkpara_"> <strong>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</strong> (/ˌkaɪbər pəkˈtuːŋkwə/; Pashto: خېبر پښتونخوا; Urdu, Hindko: خیبر پختونخوا) commonly abbreviated as KP or KPK, is one of the four provinces of Pakistan. Located in the northwestern region of the country, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the smallest province of Pakistan by land area and the third-largest province by population after Punjab and Sindh. It shares land borders with the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan to the south, Punjab to the south-east and province of Gilgit-Baltistan to the north and north-east, as well as Islamabad Capital Territory to the east, Autonomous Territory of Azad Jammu and Kashmir to the north-east. It shares an international border with Afghanistan to the west.

   <p  class="kpkpara_"> <strong>The Kalasha Valleys</strong> (Kalasha-mondr: کالؕاݰا دیݰ Kaĺaśa Desh; Urdu: وادی کیلاش) are valleys in Chitral District in northern Pakistan. The valleys are surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountain range. The inhabitants of the valley are the Kalash people, who have a unique culture, language and follow a form of religion that is associated with their surroundings like the mountains and rivers.[1][2][3][4] The largest and most populous valley is Bumburet (Mumuret), reached by a road from Ayun in the Kunar Valley. Rumbur is a side valley north of Bumburet. The third valley, Biriu (Birir), is a side valley of the Kunar Valley south of Bumburet.</p>

   <a id="Attabad Lake"><h1>ATTABAD LAKE</h1></a>

   <img src="IMAGES/attabad.jpeg" title="Attabad Lake" >

   <p  class="kpkpara_"> The lake was formed when Attabad village in Hunza Valley in Gilgit−Baltistan had a landslide, 14 kilometres (9 mi) upstream (east) of Karimabad that occurred on 4 January 2010. The landslide killed twenty people and blocked the flow of the Hunza River for five months. The lake flooding displaced 6,000 people from upstream villages, stranded (from land transportation routes) a further 25,000, and inundated over 19 kilometres (12 mi) of the Karakoram Highway. The lake reached 21 kilometres (13 mi) long and over 100 metres (330 ft) in depth by the first week of June 2010 when it began flowing over the landslide dam, completely submerging lower Shishkat and partly flooding Gulmit.[3] The subdivision of Gojal has the greatest number of flooded buildings, over 170 houses, and 120 shops. The residents also had shortages of food and other items due to the blockage of the Karakoram Highway.[4]

    By 4 June, water outflow from the lake had increased to 100 m3/s (3,700 cu ft/s).[5]
    
    Water levels continued to rise in 18 June 2010 caused by a difference in the outflow and inflow of the new lake. As bad weather continued, the supply of food, medicine and other goods was stopped as all forms of transportation including helicopter service to Hunza could not resume.[6]</p>

 <p  class="kpkpara_"> <strong>Murree (Punjabi, Urdu: مری)</strong> is a mountain resort city, located in the Galyat region of the Pir Panjal Range, within the Muree District of Punjab, Pakistan. It forms the outskirts of the Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area, and is about 30 km (19 mi) northeast of Islamabad. It has average altitude of 2,291 metres (7,516 ft). The British built this town during their rule to escape the scorching heat in the plains of Punjab during the summer.[2][3]

    Construction of the town was started in 1851 on the hill of Murree as a sanatorium for British troops. The permanent town of Murree was constructed in 1853 and the church was consecrated shortly thereafter. One main road was established, commonly referred to even in modern times, as the mall. Murree was the summer headquarters of the colonial Punjab Government until 1876 when it was moved to Shimla.[4][3]
    
    Murree became a popular tourist station for British citizens of the British Raj. Several prominent Britons were born here including Bruce Bairnsfather, Francis Younghusband, Reginald Dyer[5] and Joanna Kelley.[6] During the colonial era, access to commercial establishments was restricted for non-Europeans. Such establishments included Lawrence College, Murree.</p>

    <p  class="kpkpara_"> <strong>Babusar Pass or Babusar Top (Urdu: درہ بابوسر)</strong> (elevation 4,173 metres or 13,691 feet)[1][2] is a mountain pass in Pakistan at the north of the 150 km (93 miles) long Kaghan Valley, connecting it via the Thak Nala with Chilas on the Karakoram Highway (KKH). It is the highest point in Kaghan Valley that can be easily accessed by cars.

        The Babusar Pass connects Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with Gilgit-Baltistan.[3] It is one of the most dangerous routes in Pakistan. Every year, many deaths happen here due to the mountainous slopes, which are among the most dangerous in the world. The most common reason for death is the brake failure of cars due to inexperience.[3] Babusar Top was originally known as Babur Top, originating from the fact that the Mughal emperor Babur used to pass through this area in the early 16th century. Nowadays however, it is commonly referred to as Babusar Top.</p>
